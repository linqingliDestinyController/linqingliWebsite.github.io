## Research experience

### Apr 2023- Oct 2023 Knowledge Graph Enhanced Intelligent Tutoring System Based on Exercise Representativeness and Informativeness.
  * *Related Methods*:Recommendation System, Knowledge Graph, Neural Network, Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network, Cognitive Diagnosis Model.
  * *Aim*: This paper aims to propose a novel intelligent tutoring system to recommend personalized exercises to students and define two exercise features, informativeness, and representativeness, to measure the quality of exercises.
  * *Contribution*:(1)Based on the heterogeneous graph connecting students nodes, exercises nodes, and skills nodes, a novel graph neural network is used to construct the exercise node embedding or skill node embedding. (2)Two unique methods are created to turn a one-dimensional knowledge graph into a multidimensional knowledge graph and combine five interpretable node attributes to determine the importance of a skill node. (3)Exercise representativeness and exercise informativeness are developed to assess exercise quality using KL Divergence and node characteristics. The intelligent tutoring system then recommends users with high-quality exercises based on their knowledge proficiency, as predicted by the cognitive diagnosis model.

### Jan 2023- Mar 2023 Knowledge Relation Rank Enhanced Heterogeneous Learning Interaction Modeling for Neural Graph Forgetting Knowledge Tracing. 
  * *Related Methods*: Attention Mechanism, Heterogeneous graph, Neural Network, Knowledge Tracing Model.
  * *Aim*: This paper aims to propose a novel knowledge tracing model to estimate the knowledge state of students considering the skill relation matrix and exercise relation matrix.
  * *Contribution*:(1) A calibrated approach is proposed for evaluating the relevance of skills or exercises and constructing the calibrated skill relation matrix and exercise relation matrix. (2) An exercise feature modeling method is proposed to estimate exercise features in order to develop the final exercise embedding based on the graph neural network and exercise difficulty. (3) A unique attention mechanism is created to predict student performance by assessing the relative distance between input elements and modeling students' forgetting behavior.

### Dec 2022- Feb 2023 Calibrated Q-Matrix-Enhanced Deep Knowledge Tracing with Relational Attention Mechanism. 
  * *Related Methods*: Attention Mechanism, Knowledge Tracing, Feature Modeling.
  * *Aim*: This paper focuses on designing a knowledge tracing model to predict the performance of students.
  * *Contribution*:(1) To model the exercises, three types of feature modeling are introduced: exercise relation modeling, student behavior modeling, and forgetting behavior modeling.
(2) Two types of attention mechanisms are created to process exercise embedding and output student knowledge states.
