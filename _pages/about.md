## Research experience

### Apr 2023- Oct 2023 Knowledge Graph Enhanced Intelligent Tutoring System Based on Exercise Representativeness and Informativeness.
  * *Related Methods*:Recommendation System, Knowledge Graph, Neural Network, Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network, Congitive Diagnosis Model.
  * *Aim*: This paper aims to propose a novel intelligenet tutoring system to recommend the personalized exercises to students and define two exercises features,informativess and representativess, to measure the quality of exercises.
  * *Contribution*:(1)Based on the heterogeneous graph connecting students nodes, exercises nodes, and skills nodes, a novel graph neural network is used to construct the exercise node embedding or skill node embedding. (2)Two unique methods are created to turn a one-dimensional knowledge graph into a multidimensional knowledge graph and combine five interpretable node attributes to determine the importance of a skill node. (3)exercise representativeness and exercise informativeness are developed to assess exercise quality using KL Divergence and node characteristics. The intelligent tutoring system then recommends users with high quality exercises based on their knowledge proficiency, as predicted by the cognitive diagnosis model.

### Jan 2023- Mar 2023 Knowledge Relation Rank Enhanced Heterogeneous Learning Interaction Modeling for Neural Graph Forgetting Knowledge Tracing. 
  * *Related Methods*: Attention Mechanism, Heterogeneous graph, Neural Network, Knowledge Tracing Model.
  * *Aim*: This paper aims to propose a novel knowledge tracing model to estimate the knowledge state of students considering the skill relation matrix and exercise relation matrix.
  * *Contribution*:(1) a calibrated method is proposed to consider the importance of skills or exercises and generate the calibrated skill relation matrix and exercise relation matrix.
(2) a exercise feature modeling methods is proposed to estimate the features of exercises to generate the final exercise embedding based on the graph neural network and exercise difficulty. (3) an novel attention mechanism is designed to predict the performance of students by analyzing the relative distance between input elements and modeling the forgetting behavior of students.

### Dec 2022- Feb 2023 Calibrated Q-Matrix-Enhanced Deep Knowledge Tracing with Relational Attention Mechanism. 
  * *Related Methods*: Attention Mechanism, Knowledge Tracing, Feature Modeling.
  * *Aim*: This paper focuses on dsigning a knowledge tracing model to predict the performance of students.
  * *Contribution*:(1) three types of feature modeling are introduced to model the exercises from exercise relation aspect, student behavior aspect, and forgetting behavior aspect.
(2) two types of attention mechanisms are designed to process the exercise embedding and output the knowledge porficiency of students.
